# GCD_VHDL

## Desiging a Circuit for computing Greatest Common Divisor(GCD):

In this project, we designed a circuit to compute the GCD of two numbers. First you need to clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/miladebrahimipour/GCD_VHDL.git
    cd GCD_VHDL

To simulate the circuit you first need to create a project in ModelSim. Then, compile all *.vhd files, and finally, simulate the test bench file (gcd_tb.vhd).

Please note that the testbench uses pico-second standard as timing and it takes around 12 clocks to produce the results.
